# Group 10 project
# Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting of Electric Load.

This project applies deep learning (DL) models to a real-world time series dataset of Zone-1 electric load across multiple Moroccan cities.
The goal is to predict the 1-hour-ahead load using historical measurements, temporal features, and machine-learning techniques.
